## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- **Device**: Mining Capable Phone or ARM SBC 64-bit CPU and Operating System
- **Operating System**: Linux if you are on an SBC, Userland or Termux (including termux-api and termux-boot) if you are on Android.
- **RIG Password**: Add a RIG in the GUI to get the password generated (Details in [Installation](#installation)).
- **For Windows Installation Method**:
  - **Python**: Installed on your Windows system.
  - **Android SDK**: Installed and configured.
  - **USB Debugging**: Enabled on the phone, and the phone is connected to the host via USB.

## Installation

Go to [Rig Overview](https://api.rg3d.eu:8443/rig_overview.php) and add a rig, **Make Sure to Document the Password!**

### 1. Direct Installation on the Phone/SBC

Follow these steps to install the Mining System directly on your Phone/SBC:

Open your terminal and execute the following command:

```sh
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dismaster/RG3DUI/main/install.sh >/dev/null 2>&1 && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
```

Enter the password you obtained when adding the rig to the dashboard.

### 2. Installation via Python Script (Windows)

If you are running Windows, you can also install the mining software via a Python script. This method is useful if you prefer managing the installation from a desktop environment.

#### Prerequisites for Windows Installation:
- Ensure you have Python and the Android SDK installed on your Windows machine.
- Enable USB debugging on your Android phone (go to *Settings > Developer Options* and turn on *USB Debugging*).
- Connect your phone to the Windows machine via USB.

#### Steps:

1. **Download the Python Script**:  
   Download the installer script from the GitHub repository by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/dismaster/RG3DUI.git
   ```
   This will create a folder with all necessary files.

2. **Run the Python Script**:  
   Navigate to the folder where the script is located:
   ```sh
   cd RG3DUI
   ```
   Run the Python installer:
   ```sh
   python rg3d_installer.py
   ```
   The script will automatically download ADB and APK files into the folder and initiate the setup process.

3. **Follow On-Screen Instructions**:  
   The script will guide you through the installation process, including deploying the necessary APKs to your connected Android phone. Make sure your phone is recognized by the script (you can check if it's connected by running `adb devices`).

4. **Enter RIG Password**:  
   As with the phone installation, enter the password generated when you added the rig to the dashboard.

## Configuration

After installation, the scripts will populate any required configuration according to your RIG configuration itself. After install is complete, wait a couple of minutes and make sure the dashboard shows the device mining!

## Information

The GUI is being updated in specific time frames!

1. Rig Details: every 2 minute(s)
2. Miner Details: every 1 minute(s)

# HAPPY MINING!

## CPU/ARM Hashrate Collection

We're looking for help to gather information around CPU/ARM hashrates in order to create a new website that will showcase all relevant data. Your participation will help expand the list of known configurations and their performance.

### How to Participate

You can easily help us gather this data by running a script on your **Termux**, **Userland**, or **SBC** installation. Follow these steps to participate:

1. Ensure that `ccminer` is running and that API access is properly configured. Modify the `config.json` file of `ccminer` with the following lines to enable the API:

   ```json
   "api-allow": "0/0",
   "api-bind": "0.0.0.0:4068"
This will allow the script to access ccminer via its default API port (4068), enabling it to gather relevant information like accepted shares and hashrates.

Run the following commands in your terminal to download and execute the script:
Copy code
```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dismaster/RG3DUI/main/rg3d_cpu.sh && chmod +x rg3d_cpu.sh && ./rg3d_cpu.sh
```
Optionally, you can set up the script to run every 5 minutes using a cron job by running:
Copy code
```sh
./rg3d_cpu.sh -crontab
```
What the Script Does
Detects the operating system and downloads the appropriate cpu_check binary for your environment.
Gathers information about your CPU (model, frequency) and the average hashrate (KHS).
Checks if ccminer is running and using the default API port (4068) to retrieve mining statistics.
Sends the gathered data to the server for inclusion in the public database.
This information will be used to build a public page where users can search for CPU models, architectures, and frequencies, along with their corresponding hashrates.

Thank you for helping us build a valuable resource for the community!
